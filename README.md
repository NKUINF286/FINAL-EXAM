# FINAL-EXAM
Files for Final Exam Project
Hello! This is an updated version of the Mercy Neigborhood Ministries website, found heree: http://www.mercyneighborhoodministries.org/

Some of the changes that we have made to the site were to remove some of the clutter from some of the web pages, and to reduce 
the number of web pages, as there were several pages that either had redundant information, or no (relavent) information at all. 
Other changes that were made were to the font of the text at the top of the screne, to try to match the one that was found in their logo, 
try to modernize some of the pages, and generally clean the site up a bit. We tried to keep the general layout, however, and most of the 
same information that the site originally contianed.
